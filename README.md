### Robot-IDE
As the heart of our project, we had to make sure to find the best JS interpreter possible. We first thought about writing our own interpreter but then found [Esper.js](https://github.com/codecombat/esper.js).

### Tutorials
Researching other, already existing projects, we could extract some of their experience of teaching and put that gained knowledge into our tutorials.

### WebRTC
As the main concept behind our communication between clients and presenter, we had to make sure that it's the right technology for what we want to use it for.

### Blockly
Understanding and writing valid code is hard and beginner unfriendly. That's the reason Google build the graphical programming language Blockly!  
[Blockly Advanced](./blockly.md)

### Comparable Projects
To make our project unique compared to the projects already existing, we took 4 of the more known projects and analyzed their good and bad parts.

#### CodeOrg
Probably the most well known and popular project that teaches kids to code. The hour of code is very popular.  
[Analyzing CodeOrg](./other_games/codeOrg.md)

#### CodingGame
CodingGame is aimed at more experienced and older kids, teaching more complex techniques and hosting quite hard tasks.

#### LightBot
This mobile game starts really easy and adds more and  more complex concepts over time eventually getting quite challenging.

#### RunMarco
Being also a mobile game, RunMarco is a more beginner friendly introduction to logic. It's really easy and aimed at smaller children.
