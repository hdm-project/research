# [The Game](https://www.allcancode.com)  

## What does the player do
The player drag and drops code blocks into a canvas to stack up a sequence. The sequence will then be executed by either the male or female character. The goal is to reach the in gold highlighted tile.

## Sequence
For each level you build a stack of code blocks, which are executed top to bottom once the play button is clicked.
If the level's goal wasn't reached at the end of the code block stack, you can modify and start it again.

## Levels
In each level, the player has to move the character to the golden tile. There are no optional ways, only one way is
possible, so you know exactly what to do.

## Bad
#### Left and right rotation is added seperately
#### Extremely slow progress
#### Always 3/3 Stars (until level 14)
#### Because of the slow progress, the code stacks get pretty tall
#### No hint on how to get more stars (probably less code blocks)
